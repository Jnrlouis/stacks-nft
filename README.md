### Stacks Fren

Send 100 satoshis to reserve and mint your stacks fren!

Verification that the sender of the transaction is the same as the user that is signed in is currently done on the UI level and not the contract level, as the current implementation of the bitcoin-clarity library doesn't support taproot or segwit transactions yet - just legacy. (It is still WIP to include the others).

This would be changed after the implementation is complete!

Verification that the amount sent is 100 satoshis is done on the contract level.
