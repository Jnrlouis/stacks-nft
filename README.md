Stacks is a Layer-1 open-source blockchain network that leverages Bitcoin’s security and allows smart contracts and decentralized apps to use Bitcoin’s state, despite being a separate blockchain.

The programming language used on Stacks is Clarity and the native token on the Stacks blockchain is STX.

I wrote more about it in this [article](https://medium.com/@chibuezelouis/create-an-nft-collection-on-stacks-with-metadata-stored-on-ipfs-710fb21ce79d)
